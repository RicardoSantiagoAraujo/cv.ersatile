# CV.ERTEX

CV.ERTEX is a submodule of the CV.ERSATILE project. It consists of a simple website to host your various CV versions, and can be configured to display CVs from different profiles regardless of type (PDF or HTML).
As such, it profiles a hub where your various CV's can be kept up to date and available online.


## How to use

1. Within each profile in CV.ERSATILE, place CV's that you want to make available in a **published_pdfs** folder.
2. Add these pdfs and any desired HTML CV in the **config.ts** file of CV.ERTEX.
