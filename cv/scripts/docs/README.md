### Generating documentation:
1- Move into the scripts/docs/ directory.


2- Automatically generate .srt files from docstrings in python files modules:

````
sphinx-apidoc -o source/contents/modules  ../../
````

3- Generate the html build (alternatively, epub or others):
````
make html
````
````
make epub
````
It might be a good idea to delete the existing build in docs/build/html before generating the new one.
